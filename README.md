### D3 Intro

JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data

Binds data into DOM and then apply data-driven transformation to DOM. D3 doesn’t provide pre-generated graph or visualization, But it solves the crux problem in data visualization and gives the freedom of creative features.

Know about SVG, HTML5, CSS3 - D3 is playground to play with it.

D3’s functional style allows code reuse.

Definitely not for common graphs, just out of the box visualization.

### D3 Selection

Like CSS selector and JavaScript querySelector/querySelectorAll, D3 provides selector for DOM nodes.
